# starter
A minimal, clean, modern theme for Ghost blog.

*Special Thanks to [byfortress](http://byfortress.com/downloads/starter). His theme can be download for free but you can buy him a beer [here](https://creativemarket.com/lucas_delrio/1069273-Starter-Free-Ghost-Theme). Actually I bought it before he switched it to free =]]*

## Features

- Compatible with Ghost >= 2.0
- Fully responsive
- Retina ready
- Google Fonts
- Multiple author support
- Disqus comments
- Featured posts

Some texts in theme are in Vietnamese. You can change it later :)

## Configuration

Make sure you modify all my personal stuff, such as:

- Disqus shortname (`index.js`)
- Google Analytics (`default.hbs`)

Please refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/quangtt/starter/wiki) for more details.
